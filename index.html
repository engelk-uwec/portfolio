            <p id="intro">Hi, My name is Kristiana and I am a graphic communications major at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire.  I am from a small southern Wisconsin town, just south of Madison.  I enjoy being creative and I spend some of my free time doing just that.  When not being creative, I enjoy spending time outside and time with family and friends, among other activities.</p>

            <p>Due to the fact that I recently declared my major, I do not have a lot of work experiance specific to graphic communications.  For the most part, I have done art just as a hobby and in different forms.  This website will focus on some of the things that I have done including drawing, photography, and a few projects that I designed while in a graphic design class.</p>
